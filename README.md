## Indicator Functionality

The `ScanChartPatterns` function is responsible for detecting different chart patterns. Currently, four patterns are being detected: Shoulder Head Shoulder / Reverse pattern, Triple Top / Bottom pattern, Cup pattern, and Flags pattern. The code for detecting each pattern is not included in this sample code and needs to be implemented separately.

## Chart Pattern Detection

The `DetectChartPatterns` function is used to detect chart patterns on different timeframes. The function sets the chart period to different timeframes (m1, m5, m15, m30, h1) using the `ChartSetInteger` function and then calls the `ScanChartPatterns` function to scan for patterns on that timeframe.

## Real-Time Analysis

The `RealTimeAnalysis` function is an infinite loop that continuously performs real-time analysis. It calls the `DetectChartPatterns` function to detect chart patterns and then analyzes potential trading opportunities based on the detected patterns. The analysis code is not included in this sample code and needs to be implemented separately. The function pauses for 1 second using the `Sleep` function before performing the next analysis.

## Entry Point

The `OnInit` function is the entry point of the trading robot. It is responsible for initializing the robot and starting the real-time analysis. Any necessary initialization code specific to the trading robot should be implemented in this function.

## Program Execution

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the price chart. This function is where the program's main execution logic should be implemented. However, no specific code is included in this sample code.

## Program Termination

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is terminated. Any necessary termination code should be implemented in this function.
